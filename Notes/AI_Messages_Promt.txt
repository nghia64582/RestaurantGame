I'm building a restaurant simulator game, the main flow is:
S1 : The guest move into the restaurant
S2 : A waiter move to the guest from waiting position
and bring the menu to the guest.
S3 : The guest watches the menu for a few seconds and
pick some dishes.
S4 : The waiter move to a random chef and give him
the order.
S5 : The chef cook the meal
S6 : After the meal is finished, the waiter brings 
the dishes to the guest.
S7 : After the guest finished his meal, he would react
some emotions.
S8 : A waiter moves to the guest and bring the receipt
S9 : The guest leaves the restaurant.
Please write me some conversation sentences for each steps
